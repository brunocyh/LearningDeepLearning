This repo stores all the homework submitted (or at least intended to) for the online course.
I am currently enrolled into 2 online course delivered by Siraj Raval.
- The math of Intelligence
- Introduction to Tensorflow

My goal is to complete both course with deep understanding and pratical experience within
5 weeks. Thus, I would have to complete around 4 videos per week.
I treat it as a way to entertain myself, thus, I will only do it during my free time.
Course begins: 22 April 2018
Course ends: 27 May 2018

Good luck to me
